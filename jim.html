				<h3>Jungle is Massive</h3>
				</br>
				<p>This is a simple text based game where you venture through the jungle to unravel its mysteries .</p>
				</br>
				<p>Created as a simple test of basic abilities when re-introducing myself to programming , a place to start and get myself comfortable before going on to learn new things .</p>
				</br>
				<p>The story ventures into two different sides of the jungle , where you encounter different types of foes on either side . You can find items on different paths that can assist you , and they will be vital to reaching the end .</p>
				</br>
				<p>Don 't be afraid to go backwards every once in a while , it could surprise you .</p>
				</br>
				<p>*I plan to try to embed the game here , but I don 't know when*</p>
