				<p>My name is Grant , but I often go by the alias of " Dobby " due to a childhood nickname .</p>
				</br>
				<p>This can be turned to any variation beginning with " Dob " , which is where Dobbland comes from .</p>
				</br>
				<p>NewDobbland is my developer name ; I begun getting back into coding since I lost my touch years ago after college in 2014 .</p>
				</br>
				<p>When I used to program , I would use Java . However , since this is passed it 's end-life and the likes of programming is moving forward with incredible pace , I begun by taking up Python ( both 2 and 3 ) to get back into the swing of things .</p>
				</br>
				<p>I begun by creating a small , basic project . That is Jungle is Massive , named after a song I knew from my childhood .</p>
				</br>
				<p>I want to be able to create better , more specific programs , such as " All Launch " , which I intend to be an all purpose launcher for any . exe file . I will be thinking about this in more depth as of when I finish JiM , and have learnt more about the use of the relevant programming languages .</p>
